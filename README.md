Android application to show all spawn point as a overlay

### Note
1. Due to performance issue spawn points only show when zoom level >= 16
2. Long press the map will create a 200m range circle (i.e. your sight in game)
3. Press the bottom-right button to open the overlay, it will close when you open the app again (maybe add a drag to remove function later, maybe...)
4. Semi-transparent marker means the spawn point will spawn within 5 minutes
